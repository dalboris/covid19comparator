      <h1>Coronavirus Comparator</h1>

      <p>This website is under construction.</p>

      <p>It will allow you to compare the number of cases and/or deaths of
      COVID-19 (a.k.a. coronavirus) across countries.</p>

      <p>It should be up and running hopefully by March 18, 2020.</p>

      <p>If you are living in a country which already has more than 5
      coronavirus deaths, please stay home. Go to  <a
      href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"
      target="_blank">worldometers.info/coronavirus</a> to determine if this
      is your case. If not, please do not travel to any such country.</p>

      <p>This is not "just a flu". This may be one of the deadliest pandemics
      of the last century. We're talking hundreds of thousands of deaths
      worldwide coming in the next few months, unless aggressive social
      distancing measures are taken in all countries infected by the virus
      (and more than 5 deaths most definitely means infected). Please read the
      official <a
      href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports"
      target="_blank">situation reports</a> from the <a
      href="https://www.who.int/" target="_blank">World Health
      Organization (WHO)</a>.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, if you live in an infected country (which includes the
      United States), you can stop it. There is a simple antidote: stay home.
      It works. It's been proven. It isn't meant to save <i>you:</i> in fact,
      you will probably be fine no matter what you do. It is meant to save
      <i>others</i>. To save the <a
      href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/#who-03-03-20"
      target="_blank">3.4%</a> of people that die from the disease (<a href=
      "https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---3-march-2020"
      target="_blank" >official statement</a> from WHO, March 3). Make the
      math: if 10% of your country's population catches the disease, and 3.4%
      of people die from it, that's about 1.1 million deaths in the United
      States alone. But this is only if people don't stay home.</p>

      <p>Staying home means: don't go to school, don't go to work, don't go to
      religious celebrations, don't go to bars/restaurants/etc, don't hang out
      in your local park (yes, you can take a <i>5-min walk</i>, including
      with your dog, but no longer and stay 6-feet away from other people),
      don't go visit your family, even for just a dinner, and even your close
      family (parents/siblings/children), don't go visit your friends, and
      most importantly, don't travel for even one mile/kilometer. Just watch
      TV or your favorite streaming service instead. The only reason you
      should ever leave your front door is to buy food or medicine, to make a
      daily 5-min walk not to become insane, or if you are seriously ill and
      need to see a doctor.</p>

      <p>Obviously, there are exceptions. Medical staff should quite obviously
      go to work. Staff part of the food supply chain should quite obviously
      go to  work. Other essential administrative jobs for the country not to
      fall apart should quite obviously go to work. Otherwise, just stay
      home.</p>
