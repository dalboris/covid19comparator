      <h1>COVID-19 comparator</h1>

      <p>Wuhan started to build two hospitals and entered a drastic quarantine
      after reaching around 40 deaths, for a final death toll of around 3,000
      deaths in the province of Hubei. Meanwhile, Italy waited 600 deaths to
      take similar measures, and is on a trajectory to possibly have 15,000
      deaths or more.</p>

      <p>The United States, as of March 17, already has 99 deaths and is just
      starting to take similar measures. This means that the US is likely on a
      trajectory of at least 5,000 deaths, but potentially much more if
      stronger measures are not generalized to the whole country and people
      don't stay home. For example, if people keep socializing for one more
      week, the death toll may instead be greater than (see next section for
      details):</p>

      <p style="text-align: center">99 &times; 1.3 &times; 1.3 &times; ... (21 times) = <b>24,459 deaths</b></p>

      <p>Below, you can compare the number of deaths (or cases) between
      different countries, and see for yourself the importance of social
      distancing and taking containment measures as early as possible. In
      particular, any containment measure only starts to have positive effects
      two weeks later, which corresponds to the <a
      href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/#days"
      target="_blank">median time from first symptom to death</a>. During
      these two weeks, the number of deaths will keep growing exponentially.
      Then, the number of deaths will slow down and eventually stop about two
      more weeks later.</p>

      <div id="covid19"></div>

      <h2 id="stay-home">Understanding exponential growth</h2>

      <p>At the early stage of an epimedic, the total number of deaths grows
      exponentially. This means that each day, the total number of deaths is
      approximately equal to the previous day multiplied by a "growth factor",
      typically between 1.2 and 1.3 in the case of COVID-19. For example,
      if we assume that there are already 40 deaths in your country, and no
      containment measures are yet in place, then:</p>

      <p>After 14 days, with a <b>growth factor of 1.2</b>, the number of
      deaths would be:</p>

      <p style="text-align: center">40 &times; 1.2 &times; 1.2 &times; ... (14 times) = <b>514 deaths</b></p>

      <p>After 14 days, with a <b>growth factor of 1.3</b>, the number of
      deaths would be:</p>

      <p style="text-align: center">40 &times; 1.3 &times; 1.3 &times; ... (14 times) = <b>1,575 deaths</b></p>

      <p>Social distancing affects this growth factor, and even a small
      difference of 0.1 saves thousands of lives.</p>

      <p>The reason we chose 14 days in this example is that it corresponds to
      the <a
      href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/#days"
      target="_blank">median time from first symptom to death</a>. This means
      that once containment measures are taken, the number of deaths keeps
      growing exponentially for at least 14 more days, since most deaths in
      this period are from people that were contaminated before the
      containment measures were taken.</p>

      <p>This is why it is critical to take aggressive containment measures as
      early as possible. If a country with already 40 deaths and a growth rate
      of 1.3 waits one more week before taking aggressive measures, then
      exponential growth would continue for at least 3 weeks (21 days):</p>

      <p style="text-align: center">40 &times; 1.3 &times; 1.3 &times; ... (21 times) = <b>9,883 deaths</b></p>

      <h2 id="stay-home">What does "stay home" mean?</h2>

      <p> If you live in a country which is affected by coronavirus (for
      example, 5-10 deaths already), you must absolutely stay home. Not only
      does this protect you, but perhaps more importantly, it protects
      everyone else. Indeed, <b>it is impossible for you to know that you are
      not contagious</b>, since many infections of the virus are asymptomatic
      but still contagious, for as long as several weeks. Since it is impossible for you to know whether you are contagious,
      you must act exactly as you would if you <i>knew</i> that you were
      contagious. You must act exactly as you would if you knew that each
      contact with another human being might kill them directly, or infect
      them and  indirectly kill other people.</p>

      <p>Do not go to public places, unless stricly necessary for your
      survival (such as buying food or medecine), or strictly necessary for
      not losing your job. In particular, don't go to bars, coffee shops,
      restaurants, concert venues, theaters, discotheques, gyms, swimming
      pools, etc. Avoid public transportation at all cost unless, again, it is
      strictly necessary for your survival or not losing your job.</p>

      <p>Stop seeing your friends and family members unless you already live
      under the same roof, or unless they cannot go shopping themselves and
      depend on you for their survival. We know, this is by far the hardest
      part. But by not seeing them, you protect them, and you protect the
      people around them. Remember, there is a very real chance that you are
      infected and contagious without knowing it. Call them as often as you
      please.</p>

      <p>Do not practice any sport requiring more than one person: gym alone
      in your living room is okay, but tennis is not okay (you touch your
      face, then the ball, then your opponent does the same). Any team sport
      is obviously not okay. Importantly, don't go skiing, climbing, or any
      activity where the risk of injury might strain the healthcare system,
      which is already, or going to be, over capacity.</p>

      <p>It is okay a take a daily <i>15-min walk or run</i> in the direct
      proximity of your front door to get some fresh air and exercice once per
      day (or walk your dog), and not go insane. But stay 6-feet/2-meter away
      from other people. Do not hang out in parks. It's okay to walk/run in a
      local park if it is part of your daily 15-min outdoor routine, but do
      not seat on any bench, or hang out there. In particular, do not meet any
      friends or family members in a park, or anywhere.</p>

      <p>Very importantly, do not travel, by any means of transportation,
      unless for buying food/medecine or go to work. Don't use your car, don't
      use your bike, don't use your electric scooter, don't use your
      skateboard. Using any means of transportation for non-essential activity
      means traveling too far from home and potentially carrying the virus to
      new places where it hasn't been yet.</p>

      <p>If possible, do not go to school/work. Try to see with your boss
      whether it's possible to work from home. However, please do not lose
      your job over this: just hope that your political leaders close your
      workplace as soon as possible. If at work/school, try to stay
      6-feet/2-meter away from anyone, and wash your hands as often as
      possible (e.g., every hour). The virus can stay contagious on surfaces
      (e.g., door handles, keyboards) for <b>days</b>. Obviously, do not shake
      hands or hug anyone at school/work.</p>

      <p>We know that this is not easy. We don't like changing our habits. We
      don't like not seeing our loved ones. We don't like cancelling trips. We
      don't like cancelling weddings. But we're hundreds of millions of people
      currently doing it around the world (either self-imposed or imposed by
      our governements), and really, sitting in our couches watching TV alone
      or with our household for one month is a small price to pay to stop the
      pandemic, and potentially save the lives of millions of people.</p>
