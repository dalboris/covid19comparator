      <p>The province of Hubei in China waited 40 deaths before entering
      lockdown, for a final death toll of 3,000. Without the lockdown, it
      could have been 120,000 deaths, if we assume that 40% of the population
      would have been infected with an infection fatality risk of 0.5%. So we
      know that lockdowns work, but acting early is critical. For example,
      Italy waited 600 deaths, and is on a trajectory to have more than 10,000
      deaths (6,820 as of March 24).</p>

      <p>Indeed, at the early stage of any epidemic, the death toll grows
      exponentially, which means that each day, the death toll is increased by
      an (almost) fixed percentage, called the <b>growth rate</b>. In the case
      of COVID-19, this growth rate is typically around 30%, which means that
      the death toll doubles every three days. Let's take the United States
      for example. You can see how every three days, the death toll
      doubles:</p>

      <p>Obviously the growth can't be exponential <i>forever</i>. It stops
      either once most of the population is infected (example: 120,000
      deaths), or once the country succeeds in stopping the propagation
      (example: 3,000 deaths). Unfortunately, even when a country enters
      lockdown early, this exponential growth typically doesn't stop before
      <i>at least</i> 14 days after lockdown, which corresponds to the <a
      href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/#days"
      target="_blank">median time from first symptom to death</a>. Indeed,
      most deaths in this 14-day period after lockdown are from people that
      were already contaminated before the lockdown. So if a country currently
      has 100 deaths with a growth rate of 30%, and enters lockdown today, the
      death toll is expected to be at least:</p>

      <p style="text-align: center">100 &times; 1.3 &times; 1.3 &times; ... (14 times) = <b>3,937 deaths</b></p>

      <p>But if they wait 7 more days, the death toll is expected to be at
      least:</p>

      <p style="text-align: center">100 &times; 1.3 &times; 1.3 &times; ... (21 times) = <b>24,706 deaths</b></p>

      <p class="note">Note: the final death toll will depend on many factors,
      such as population density, cultural norms, age demographics, whether
      hospitals will be in shortage of ventilators and ICU beds, and whether
      softer measures where already in place a few days/weeks before the
      lockdown, such as closing schools, disallowing mass gatherings, etc.</p>

      <p>This is why every day counts. Countries which are suffering
      widespread infections must enter lockdown as soon as possible. If your
      government doesn't order a lockdown, please self-quarantine, to take
      matters into your own hands. Stay home, to save the lives of tens of
      thousands of people, if not hundreds of thousands or more.</p>

      <p>Below, you can compare the number of deaths in different countries.
      This comparator allows you to see for yourself how scary exponential
      growth is, and understand why it is so important to enter lockdown as
      soon as possible. Remember, the death toll is expected to keep growing
      exponentially for 14 days after lockdown, which is why if you are not
      doing it already, you should start staying home now, even if the number
      of deaths in your country doesn't look scary yet. Exponential growth is
      deceptive: it looks slow at the beginning, but then in a matter of days
      you get thousands of deaths.</p>

        <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins University</a>
      </p>

      <p class="note">Note 1: this is a work in progress, more functionality should be
      added little by little.</p>

      <p class="note">Note 2: different countries have different testing
      policies, so you can't directly compare the number of confirmed cases
      between countries, nor you can compare their <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_fatality_rate"
      target="_blank">case-fatality ratio</a>. However, the number of cases is
      useful to estimate the growth rate in countries where the number of
      deaths is still too low to be able to do any meaningful statistics.
      Also, the number of cases is useful to detect trend reversal on a
      per-country basis: the number of cases typically stops being exponential
      before the number of deaths, due to the delay between first symptom and
      death.</p>

      <p class="note">Note 3: the true infection-fatality risk (what are your
      chances of dying if infected) is typically lower than the current
      case-fatality ratio (ratio between confirmed deaths and confirmed cases)
      since many people are infected but not tested. However, it may also be
      higher, since some people have already been tested positive and haven't
      died yet, but may die in the coming weeks. Taking all that into account
      (estimation of number of people really infected, and delay between
      infection and death), epidemiologists estimate the true
      infection-fatality risk of SARS-CoV-2 to be <a
      href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0320_article"
      target="_blank">around 0.25%-3%</a>, which is 10-100 times more deadly
      than the average <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"
      target="_blank">seasonal flu</a> (~0.03%). Of course, there is a
      possibility that despite the best efforts of our scientists, we are
      largely underestimating the current number of infected people (and thus
      overestimating the true infection-fatality risk), such as argued by <a
      href="https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/foc67z/fundamental_principles_of_epidemic_spread/"
      target="_blank">this study</a>. However, most studies don't support such
      an optimistic scenario.</p>

      <p class="note">Note 4: without aggressive social distancing measures,
      SARS-CoV-2 may <a
      href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-infection-outbreak-worldwide-virus-expert-warning-today-2020-03-02/"
      target="_blank">infect 40%-70% of the population</a>, not just ~10% like
      the seasonal flu, since no one has immunity and there is no vaccine yet.
      This means that it has the potential to kill more than 50 million people
      worldwide, not just 500,000 like the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza" target="_blank">seasonal
      flu</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic"
      target="_blank">2009 H1N1 flu pandemic</a>. In fact, this is the most
      dangerous respiratory pandemic since the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu" target="_blank">1918
      Spanish flu</a>. Fortunately, most countries are indeed taking
      aggressive social distancing measures as recommended by the scientific
      community, so we should end up nowhere near these worst case
      scenarios.</p>

      <p class="note">Note 5: even though this pandemic is really bad
      (possibly the worst in the past 100 years), we've been through worse in
      history. This is not an apocalypse. Countries won't collapse. Life will
      go on. Every year, worldwide, there are approximately <a
      href="https://ourworldindata.org/births-and-deaths" target="_blank">140
      million births and 60 million deaths</a>. So there is no need to panic:
      all we need is to do is to try to save as many people as possible by
      acting rationally and taking effective actions based on best available
      scientific knowledge. And this is exactly what most countries are doing
      with these lockdown measures. We'll get through this, don't worry. But
      do stay home to save the lives of as many people as possible, especially
      the people you love and live near you.</p>

      <h2 id="stay-home">What does "stay home" mean?</h2>

      <p>If you live in a country which is affected by coronavirus (for
      example, 5-10 deaths already), you must absolutely stay home. Not only
      does this protect you, but perhaps more importantly, it protects
      everyone else. Indeed, <b>it is impossible for you to know that you are
      not contagious</b>, as it seems possible to have zero symptoms  but
      still be contagious. Since it is impossible for you to know whether you
      are contagious, you must act exactly as you would if you <i>knew</i>
      that you were contagious. You must act exactly as you would if you knew
      that each contact with another human being might kill them directly, or
      infect them and indirectly kill other people.</p>

      <p>Do not go to public places, unless strictly necessary for your
      survival (such as buying food or medicine), or strictly necessary for
      not losing your job. In particular, don't go to bars, coffee shops,
      restaurants, concert venues, theaters, discotheques, gyms, swimming
      pools, etc. Avoid public transportation at all cost unless, again, it is
      strictly necessary for your survival or not losing your job.</p>

      <p>Stop seeing your friends and family members unless you already live
      under the same roof, or unless they cannot go shopping themselves and
      depend on you for their survival. We know, this is by far the hardest
      part. But by not seeing them, you protect them, and you protect the
      people around them. Remember, there is a very real chance that you are
      infected and contagious without knowing it. Call them as often as you
      please.</p>

      <p>Do not practice any sport requiring more than one person: gym alone
      in your living room is okay, but tennis is not okay (you touch your
      face, then the ball, then your opponent does the same). Any team sport
      is obviously not okay. Importantly, don't go skiing, climbing, or any
      activity where the risk of injury might strain the healthcare system,
      which is already, or going to be, over capacity.</p>

      <p>It is okay a take a daily <i>15-min walk or run</i> in the direct
      proximity of your front door to get some fresh air and exercise once per
      day (or walk your dog), and not go insane. But stay 6-feet/2-meter away
      from other people. Do not hang out in parks. It's okay to walk/run in a
      local park if it is part of your daily 15-min outdoor routine, but do
      not seat on any bench, or hang out there. In particular, do not meet any
      friends or family members in a park, or anywhere.</p>

      <p>Very importantly, do not travel, by any means of transportation,
      unless for buying food/medicine or go to work. Don't use your car, don't
      use your bike, don't use your electric scooter, don't use your
      skateboard. Using any means of transportation for non-essential activity
      means traveling too far from home and potentially carrying the virus to
      new places where it hasn't been yet.</p>

      <p>If possible, do not go to school/work. Try to see with your boss
      whether it's possible to work from home. However, please do not lose
      your job over this: just hope that your political leaders close your
      workplace as soon as possible. If at work/school, try to stay
      6-feet/2-meter away from anyone, and wash your hands as often as
      possible (e.g., every hour). The virus can stay contagious on surfaces
      (e.g., door handles, keyboards) for <b>days</b>. Obviously, do not shake
      hands or hug anyone at school/work.</p>

      <p>We know that this is not easy. We don't like changing our habits. We
      don't like not seeing our loved ones. We don't like canceling trips. We
      don't like canceling weddings. But we're hundreds of millions of people
      currently doing it around the world (either self-imposed or imposed by
      our governments), and really, sitting in our couches watching TV alone
      or with our household for one month is a small price to pay to stop the
      pandemic, and potentially save the lives of hundreds of thousands of
      people.</p>
