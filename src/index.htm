      <h1>COVID-19 Comparator</h1>

      <p class="author">By Boris Dalstein. Published March 20, 2020.</p>

      <p>The province of Hubei in China waited 40 deaths before entering
      lockdown, for a final death toll of 3,000. Without the lockdown,  it
      would have been 120,000 deaths assuming an optimistic scenario of 40%
      population infected and 0.5% infection fatality risk. So we know that
      lockdowns work, but acting early is critical. For example, Italy waited
      600 deaths before entering lockdown, which is very late.</p>

      <p>Indeed, at the early stage of any epidemic, the death toll grows
      exponentially, which means that each day, the death toll is increased by
      a fixed percentage, called the <b>growth rate</b>. In the case of
      COVID-19, this growth rate is typically around 30%. Let's take the
      United States as an example:</p>

      <table class="table-growth">

          <td class="td-totaldeaths">109</td>
          <td class="td-growthrate">+27%</td>
          <td class="td-growthcalc">(86 &times; 1.27 = 109)</td>

          <td class="td-growthrate">+38%</td>

        </tr>
      </table>

      </p>

      <p>Obviously the growth can't be exponential <i>forever</i>. It stops
      either once most of the population is infected (= 120,000 deaths), or
      once we succeed in stopping the propagation (= 3,000 deaths).
      Unfortunately, even when a country/region enters lockdown early on, this
      exponential growth doesn't stop before <i>at least</i> 14 days after
      lockdown, which corresponds to the <a
      href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/#days"
      target="_blank">median time from first symptom to death</a>. Indeed,
      most deaths in this 14-day period after lockdown are from people that
      were already contaminated before the lockdown. So if the US entered
      countrywide lockdown on March 19, the death toll would have been at
      least:</p>

      <p style="text-align: center">207 &times; 1.3 &times; 1.3 &times; ... (14 times) = <b>8,150 deaths</b></p>

      <p>But they didn't. If they wait 7 more days, the death toll will be at least:</p>

      <p style="text-align: center">207 &times; 1.3 &times; 1.3 &times; ... (21 times) = <b>51,142 deaths</b></p>

      <p>Every day counts. Countries which are suffering widespread infections
      must enter lockdown as soon as possible. If your government doesn't
      order a lockdown, please self-quarantine, to take matters into your own
      hands. Stay home, to save the lives of tens of thousands of people, if
      not millions.</p>

      <p>Below, you can compare the number of deaths in different countries.
      This comparator allows you to see for yourself how scary exponential
      growth is. This comparator allows you to understand why it is so
      important to enter lockdown TODAY. Remember, the death toll will keep
      growing exponentially for 14 days after lockdown, which is why you
      really need to start staying home right now, even if the number of
      deaths in your country doesn't look scary yet. Exponential growth is
      deceptive: it looks slow at the beginning, but then in a matter of days
      you get thousands of deaths.</p>

      <h2 id="stay-home">What does "stay home" mean?</h2>

      <p>If you live in a country which is affected by coronavirus (for
      example, 5-10 deaths already), you must absolutely stay home. Not only
      does this protect you, but perhaps more importantly, it protects
      everyone else. Indeed, <b>it is impossible for you to know that you are
      not contagious</b>, as it seems possible to have zero symptoms  but
      still be contagious. Since it is impossible for you to know whether you
      are contagious, you must act exactly as you would if you <i>knew</i>
      that you were contagious. You must act exactly as you would if you knew
      that each contact with another human being might kill them directly, or
      infect them and indirectly kill other people.</p>

      <p>Do not go to public places, unless strictly necessary for your
      survival (such as buying food or medicine), or strictly necessary for
      not losing your job. In particular, don't go to bars, coffee shops,
      restaurants, concert venues, theaters, discotheques, gyms, swimming
      pools, etc. Avoid public transportation at all cost unless, again, it is
      strictly necessary for your survival or not losing your job.</p>

      <p>Stop seeing your friends and family members unless you already live
      under the same roof, or unless they cannot go shopping themselves and
      depend on you for their survival. We know, this is by far the hardest
      part. But by not seeing them, you protect them, and you protect the
      people around them. Remember, there is a very real chance that you are
      infected and contagious without knowing it. Call them as often as you
      please.</p>

      <p>Do not practice any sport requiring more than one person: gym alone
      in your living room is okay, but tennis is not okay (you touch your
      face, then the ball, then your opponent does the same). Any team sport
      is obviously not okay. Importantly, don't go skiing, climbing, or any
      activity where the risk of injury might strain the healthcare system,
      which is already, or going to be, over capacity.</p>

      <p>It is okay a take a daily <i>15-min walk or run</i> in the direct
      proximity of your front door to get some fresh air and exercise once per
      day (or walk your dog), and not go insane. But stay 6-feet/2-meter away
      from other people. Do not hang out in parks. It's okay to walk/run in a
      local park if it is part of your daily 15-min outdoor routine, but do
      not seat on any bench, or hang out there. In particular, do not meet any
      friends or family members in a park, or anywhere.</p>

      <p>Very importantly, do not travel, by any means of transportation,
      unless for buying food/medicine or go to work. Don't use your car, don't
      use your bike, don't use your electric scooter, don't use your
      skateboard. Using any means of transportation for non-essential activity
      means traveling too far from home and potentially carrying the virus to
      new places where it hasn't been yet.</p>

      <p>If possible, do not go to school/work. Try to see with your boss
      whether it's possible to work from home. However, please do not lose
      your job over this: just hope that your political leaders close your
      workplace as soon as possible. If at work/school, try to stay
      6-feet/2-meter away from anyone, and wash your hands as often as
      possible (e.g., every hour). The virus can stay contagious on surfaces
      (e.g., door handles, keyboards) for <b>days</b>. Obviously, do not shake
      hands or hug anyone at school/work.</p>

      <p>We know that this is not easy. We don't like changing our habits. We
      don't like not seeing our loved ones. We don't like canceling trips. We
      don't like canceling weddings. But we're hundreds of millions of people
      currently doing it around the world (either self-imposed or imposed by
      our governments), and really, sitting in our couches watching TV alone
      or with our household for one month is a small price to pay to stop the
      pandemic, and potentially save the lives of millions of people.</p>
